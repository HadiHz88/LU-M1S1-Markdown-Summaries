# Lab 1

Dear students,

Kindly prepare a small report about the docker lab :

- Team (name and id) (maximum two students as I have seen in the lab).
- brief description about installation and processing steps (in general).
- issues and problems that you are faced with.
- results (webapp, app developed using java or python programming code).
- What do you think about the ability to work with a docker environment to create an application?

Send the report to my email: <mohammad.hamze@ul.edu.lb>
